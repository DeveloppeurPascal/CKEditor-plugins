# CKEditor-plugins

Add abbreviation, acronym, language and quote HTML markups and helpers as plugins for FCKEditor 2.4.x

This repository is for old FCKEditor. I don't know if it will work on last releases. Check the documentation at https://ckeditor.com and see if there are still needed (and usable).

This code is given as it - no guarantee of any kind - no support.
